# Wazuh

## Objective

To gain hands-on experience in deploying and using Wazuh, an open-source security information and event management (SIEM) platform, for host-based intrusion detection, log analysis, and real-time threat monitoring in a simulated SOC environment.

### Skills Learned

- 🛠️ SIEM Deployment: Installed and configured Wazuh Manager, Agent, and Dashboard components for centralized monitoring.
- 🔍 Log Collection & Analysis: Collected security logs from endpoints and interpreted alerts related to file integrity, rootkits, and suspicious behavior.
- 🚨 Alert Correlation: Investigated Wazuh-generated alerts, reviewed rulesets, and identified high-confidence security incidents.
- 🔒 Host-Based Detection: Monitored systems for unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, and malware indicators.
- 📊 Dashboard Navigation: Used the Kibana-based Wazuh dashboard to visualize and query event data for security insights.



### Tools Used

- NixGuard – AI-powered cybersecurity tool used for threat detection, log analysis, and identifying suspicious network activity.
- n8n – Low-code workflow automation platform used to build and orchestrate automated threat response workflows.
- Virtual Lab Environment – Simulated real-world network using Ubuntu and Kali Linux VMs for testing intrusion scenarios and monitoring system behavior.
